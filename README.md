# af-mod-collab

Make a class to display yourself in this community mod!

## How to join?
It's quite simple!
1. Make a class in this format: 
> A spell - Q spell - W spell - E spell - R spell - Class description passive
2. Send the file over to Fishhatter, JTRNB, meso, or cookies to get your class added in!
3. Limit 1 class per person, so design wisely!
4. You may make changes to your class at any time (just send the file!)

## Github Info
Once in a while, the github will be updated with the newest classes and changes. 
**mod_output.json** is the mod file you need in order to create a party on Acolytefight.
Enter the file into Load File on the Modding page.
